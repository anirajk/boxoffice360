<h1>Boxoffice 360</h1>
<p>

    Hi all, <br/><br/>

        Welcome to our project Boxoffice 360. We represent a visualisation of a dataset of over 5000 movies. <br/>

    First technicality you need to understand about our project is that we do cross origin resource sharing. <br/>

    This is supported by github pages, we have also provided a python script based on simplehttpserver, <br/>

    there's also a chrome extension you can install to enable cors. You start by running the server. <br/>

    When you load the main page, you see the big bang timeline. you can walk through every year and when you click on an year, <br/>

    you get the big bang animation. if you hover over the different colored nodes, you can see the actors and movies. <br/>

    You can also filter movies based on an actor, if you select an actor, it will show nodes linking actors and movies. <br/>

    The main insight that you get from our big bang is how movies have evolved over time, as you can see, when you move to recent years, <br/>

    there are more movies recorded (as a proportionate sample of all movies produced). <br/>

    The other main tab is the per year visualisation tab. you can select an year and it will show top 10 movies of that year in "movie tiles", <br/>

    these movie tiles are loaded asynchronously hitting external websites, this is what the cors does. You are presented with sort buttons which can sort <br/>

    based on given attributes. once you sort based on a new criteria, the tiles are repopulated based on the latest sort parameter. <br/>

    The other interesting parts of the visualisation is the bar chart that shows top 5 grossing movies of every year. <br/>

    In addition to this, if you want to explore a movie further, you can click on the movie, which will populate the detail pane showing details of the movie <br/>
