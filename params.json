Once you finalise on an year, it will show a bunch of visualisations\r\nfor the year.\r\n\r\n### Per year Visualisations\r\n\r\nThere will be a main tab of visualisation for every year. Once you slide the slider\r\nto the corresponding set of years, it'll stabilise the view and arrange the charts.\r\nThere are three different navigations from the main page. \r\n* Clicking on actor/director will get you the personal overlay tab, you can come back to the previous tab\r\nor navigate elsewhere\r\n* Clicking on Genre/Keyword of a movie will show you to Similar movies overlay tab which \r\nsimilar movies in a seperate tab which \r\ncan navigate to the main page with the selected movie\r\n* Clicking on the boxoffice bar will take you the show you similar grossing \r\nmovies as well as movies with a similar budget as well as a details pane for the \r\ncurrent movie. you can navigate to main page again clicking on a movie\r\n\r\n\r\nKey elements in this page are Highest Grossing Movies of the year which is an \r\ninteractive bar chart. It shows top 10 moveies which are scrollable to show more\r\nand when clicked on it, it will go to an overlay boxoffice tab\r\n\r\nThere is a tile chart of movies that are sorted by a metric (eg: Most popular), \r\nthe metric is toggleable to other metrics (eg: Most rating, most facebook likes) etc\r\nThat is selected from a drop down. Clicking on any movie will update the movie detail pane\r\n\r\nMovie detail pane will have tiles showing actors/ other crew members and keywords and genre \r\nassociated with it. Clicking on a person will take you the Personal Overlay tab and Clicking\r\non the genre/keyword will take you to a tab showing list of movies that have similar keywords \r\nor fall under the same genre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
