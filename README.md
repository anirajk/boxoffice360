### Proposal
Please Refer to [Proposal](./proposal.pdf) for the detailed 
project proposal along with feedback , figures and timelines


We will do a set of visualisations about various aspects of movies released 
and documented over time from the [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com) Database.

We'll primarily be relying on a curated dataset of 5000 movies.

Start of the visualisation will include a timelapse showing a cloud of 
all the movies recorded


There will be a slider for showing the time lapse which will interact with 
movie cloud. Once you finalise on an year, it will show a bunch of visualisations
for the year.

### Per year Visualisations

There will be a main tab of visualisation for every year. Once you slide the slider
to the corresponding set of years, it'll stabilise the view and arrange the charts.
There are three different navigations from the main page. 
* Clicking on actor/director will get you the personal overlay tab, you can come back to the previous tab
or navigate elsewhere
* Clicking on Genre/Keyword of a movie will show you to Similar movies overlay tab which 
similar movies in a seperate tab which 
can navigate to the main page with the selected movie
* Clicking on the boxoffice bar will take you the show you similar grossing 
movies as well as movies with a similar budget as well as a details pane for the 
current movie. you can navigate to main page again clicking on a movie


Key elements in this page are Highest Grossing Movies of the year which is an 
interactive bar chart. It shows top 10 moveies which are scrollable to show more
and when clicked on it, it will go to an overlay boxoffice tab

There is a tile chart of movies that are sorted by a metric (eg: Most popular), 
the metric is toggleable to other metrics (eg: Most rating, most facebook likes) etc
That is selected from a drop down. Clicking on any movie will update the movie detail pane

Movie detail pane will have tiles showing actors/ other crew members and keywords and genre 
associated with it. Clicking on a person will take you the Personal Overlay tab and Clicking
on the genre/keyword will take you to a tab showing list of movies that have similar keywords 
or fall under the same genre.
